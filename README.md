# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Project
Training and testing Loan Data with Machine Learning Models for classification.
We have used Multiple Classification models:
1.K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
2.Decision Tree
3.Support Vector Machine
4.Logistic Regression
 
After finally evaluating all models using  performance metrics, we choose a single classification model with best accuracy and efficiency.
